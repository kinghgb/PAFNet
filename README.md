#abstract Camouflage Object Detection (COD) aims to find hidden objects with high color similarity to the environment.This task becomes difficult due to the fuzzy edge information of the object.Humans look at objects by zooming in when they are unsure of the object in an image. Inspired by this, we introduce the method of super-resolution into the camouflage object detection, proposed a camouflage object detection network PAFNET based on pix-shuffle feature amplification and multi-feature fusion.Specifically, during the feature extraction stage, we use the Pyramid vision transformer (PVT) for feature extraction.During the feature fusion stage, we use the pix-shuffle sampling method, commonly applied in super-resolution, to upscale features.Then through the PSFF module for multi-feature fusion, not only the two adjacent features are fusion,but also fusion of the feature of forward transmission. This addresses segmentation inaccuracies caused by significant disparities between deep semantic features and shallow details.In the feature refinement stage, we use a dilation algorithm to focus on both objects and edges, thus highly similar foreground and background can be accurately separated.Experiments on our benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other approaches, validating its effectiveness and accuracy.Source codes are available at https://github.com/kinghgb/PAFNet
